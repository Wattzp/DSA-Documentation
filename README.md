# DSA-Documentation

This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt a number of things ranging from MS Excel to SQL and now to my portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: E commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview 
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data recieved we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;

### Data Analysis

This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis.
