# DSA-Documentation

This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt a number of things ranging from MS Excel to SQL and now to my portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: E commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview 

This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data recieved we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.
